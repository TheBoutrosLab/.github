## :hospital: Welcome to Paul Boutros Lab at SBP

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
-->

As “Big Data” researchers, we both apply existing techniques and continuously work to improve them and create new methods. Much of our work to date has focused on prostate cancer, but we are increasingly applying the same techniques to cancers of the kidney, bone and connective tissue (sarcomas), brain, thyroid, ovary and other sites, and discovering fascinating commonalities across them.

Whether you are an external researcher, one of our collaborators, or someone hoping to [join our team](#briefcase-join-our-team), we encourage you to use our tools and create issues for any problems you may encounter. Together with your feedback, we can improve our tools and make them more accessible for the next generation of researchers, who will use these techniques to cure cancer and improve human health and well-being in ways we can’t imagine today!
